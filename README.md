# The Assignment
## Brief 
A customer would like to have a native mobile application that displays a simple data set. The data consists of:
    • Image
    • Title
    • Description (optional)
    
The data set is hosted in Google Docs as a spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/ 1LBqh0GRQxpZQhdpG_OR2IQaH16oCNgjIuWaYCJdWzl4/edit?usp=sharing
The spreadsheet is accessible as a CSV file through the following link: https://docs.google.com/ spreadsheets/d/1LBqh0GRQxpZQhdpG_OR2IQaH16oCNgjIuWaYCJdWzl4/export?formate=csv
The customer is responsible for the contents of this spreadsheet and therefor the data is not always reliable. For example, the size of the images is not guaranteed to be optimized for use in a mobile application.

## The Task
Build a simple application that displays the contents of the CSV in a list view. Things you have to take into consideration: 
    • Application structure
    • Performance
    • Image cache
    • Exception handling

Optional Components: 
    • Offline
    • Caching strategies
    
Detail screen with a larger version of the image, the full title and the description. 

## Restrictions 
You can build everything yourself or use existing library components. This is mainly a test to see how you would implement a development challenge. 
Try to make error handling as graceful as possible. The user should not be bugged with a lot of error messages. 

## Good luck!
